### Before contacting support

Please assure that your connection has worked before. If you have not been able to connect before, chances are very very high that this is NOT blocking but instead some configuration problem. Please see our [access methods troubleshooting section](/access-methods#toc-troubleshooting) next and make sure that you can rule out other issues.

Also, try to connect from a different IP. You can do so by switching the WIFI or by restarting your router.
