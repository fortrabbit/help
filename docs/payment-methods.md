### Credit card

Visa, MasterCart and Amex are the supported credit cards. Many debit cards are not supported, some are, try it out. US clients might need to ask their bank to allow payments from us. When setting up the payment option we'll do test charge.

### SEPA direct debit

SEPA direct debit is accessible to clients in the European Union.

### On invoice

For enterprise clients from Europe with a recurring revenue of more than 300 € we also offer to pay by bill (giro / wire) (on account, after invoice). The current workflow requires that there is already a Billing Contact including a valid payment method set up. Please <a href="#asd" onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'I would like to apply for payment on invoice …')">contact us</a> to change the payment method to on invoice. 

#### How on invoice works

+ We invoice you in USD or EUR
+ You pay in the currency as stated on your invoice
+ We provide you with our German bank routing number (IBAN + BIC)
+ Invoices are sent by e-mail monthly to the billing mail registered with our Dashboard
+ Mind that there are no extra statements or payment receipts, just the invoices
+ Invoices need to be paid within 30 days
+ We expect individual payments for each invoice
+ Each payment needs to include the exact invoice number to be matched

### Currently not supported

PayPal is NOT supported, there are no future plans for that.
