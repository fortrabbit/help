Outgoing traffic is limited for security reasons — most non-standard ports for making outgoing requests are locked. Only the most standard ports are allowed — see our [specs](http://www.fortrabbit.com/specs#firewall). Please make sure to visit that page before making your request to open ports.

1. Login to the Dashboard
2. Browse to your App
