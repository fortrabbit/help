## Use the costs overview

With our [Dashboard](/dashboard) under your [Company](/company) you can find an invoice archive. There is also an invoice draft for the currently ongoing costs for the month so far. Our pro-rate daily billing helps you to remove unnecessary Components with immediate effect. You need to have the Owner role within your Company.


## Review your Apps

See if you have any unnecessary Apps hanging around — maybe some out-of-date side project, or something that is half finished? Our Apps are designed to be disposable. 

### Create a backup before deleting any Apps

Make sure you have an up-to-date and complete local backup of your App. That way, you can easily re-deploy it again at a later stage to a new App.


### Check multi staging Apps

Do you have Apps for multi-staging here? Do you make active use of them? Remove inactive staging Apps.


### Check your scaling

Pro Apps can easily be scaled up **and down**. Review if your currently selected Components. Compare with visitors. You can experiment with a lower scaling of PHP and MySQL. Keep an eye on PHP requests and performance. Maybe you can scale down from high availability to a single Node plan. See our [scaling tips](/scaling-pro).

Sorry, Universal Apps can not be scaled down at the time of this writing (missing feature). Suggested work-around: You might spin up a new smaller App and deploy your App to that one. We are happy to assist you with that.


## Review your Company plans

Our Company plans are helping you to [collaborate](/collaboration). Review your Company team here. Do all members need to have access to your fortrabbit Apps. If not, remove them for now, you can invite them later on again. With a reduced team you might be able scale down the Company plan.
